# INEP Community Profile

## Description

The INEP Community Profile serves as a strategic planning resource for stakeholders and partners of [Illinois Nutrition Education Programs \(INEP\)](https://inep.extension.illinois.edu/).
Community members can also use the Community Programming Map tab to explore local INEP programming and public assistance sites. The Community Profile tab visualizes demographic characteristics 
throughout Illinois by county or city.

## Development

`inepdashboard` is a work in progress, with the goal of refactoring [SNAP-Ed Community Profile](https://github.com/jstadni2/snapedprofile) using the [golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) 
framework. The original dashboard is accessible via [this link](https://jstadni2.shinyapps.io/SNAP-Ed_Community_Profile/).
